# CLIProject

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/CLI_Project`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.


This application will create a list of the featured products on EnterActionApparel.com using a CLI. It will then allow the user to choose a product and get more info about it. The details will include the description, the price and the individual product webpage.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'CLI_Project'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install CLI_Project

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
