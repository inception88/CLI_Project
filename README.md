# CLIProject

This application will create a list of the featured products on EnterActionApparel.com using a CLI. It will then allow the user to choose all the items or just the items on sale. Then the user will choose a product and get more info about it. The details will include the regular price, sales price and the description.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'CLI_Project'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install CLI_Project

## Usage
